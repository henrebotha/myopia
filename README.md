# myopia

This package aims to emulate Emacs's [narrowing](www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Narrowing) functionality. The general idea is that you can spawn a dedicated buffer to edit a section of a file, restricting you from viewing or editing any other part of the file - for example, when you want to edit only a single method definition in a class file.
